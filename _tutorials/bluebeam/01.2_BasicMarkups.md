title: Basics with Markups
category: Bluebeam Basics
---

About 80% of time spent with Bluebeam will be spent in the Markups Tab in the Ribbon. For convenience the RXDS Profiles have been set up with all markups in the right toolbar. If a tool cannot be found in the Right Side Tool Bar, look for it in one of the dropdowns under the Markups Tab in the Ribbon. 

The examples below will be making use of both the Markup Ribbon and Right Side Tool Bar as well as simple keyboard shortcuts that maybe found by hovering over any markup tool item.
