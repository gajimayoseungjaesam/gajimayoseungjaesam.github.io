{:.post-intro}
**Part 3 of Drawing Processing is the final step in a processed set of drawings. Here you will learn to use Bluebeam's most widely known tool, Batch Linking** 

## Batch Linking
Now that the drawings are all set up, we can finally get into the final step which is to hyper link all the callouts. Fortunately, Bluebeam's Batch Hyperlink tool will do most of the work for us. 

1. Start with a blank Bluebeam window (Nothing should be open at this time
2. In the Ribbon go to `File --> Batch --> Link --> New`  
{% include image.html image="batchlink_1.gif" class="img-xlarge" %}  
3. Click on `Add Folders` and select the whole folder which contains the drawings (Do not select subfolders separately)  
4. Press 'Next'
{% include image.html image="batchlink_2.gif" class="img-xlarge" %}  
5. Select the `FileName` radio button to search by FileName
6. Click on Settings 
 - Set Filter Mode to `First from Start`
 - Use an underscore `_` as the filter character  
{% include image.html image="batchlink_3.gif" class="img-xlarge" %}  
7. In Part 1, we added a footer with "INDEX". Now we will change our Custom Index Dashboard that we created with the RXDS Indexer, to the word INDEX. See below:
{% include image.html image="batchlink_4.gif" class="img-xlarge" %} 
8. IMPORTANT!!! Because our Custom INDEX was already linked using the RXDS Indexer, we do not want to relink it using Bluebeams Batch Link tool. For this reason we will go back and Uncheck it
 - Click `Back`
 - Right click on the First Line Item, which is the Main Folder which holds our Custom Index, and select `Uncheck`
 - Press `Next`
{% include image.html image="batchlink_5.gif" class="img-xlarge" %} 
9. Set link options by clicking on `Link Options`. See below for RXDS Standard Settings
{% include image.html image="batchlink_6.gif" class="img-xlarge" %} 
10. Press `Run` and let Bluebeam Process
{% include image.html image="batchlink_7.gif" class="img-xlarge" %} 

## Finished
At this point your drawings have been linked but you will want to open up the Drawing_Index.pdf and double check a few pages to make sure:

- your Index works
- callouts got linked 
- INDEX footer takes you back to the index
